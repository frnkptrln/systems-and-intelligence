# 📚 Theory

This folder contains conceptual notes, essays, and theoretical reflections on:

- self-organization  
- emergence  
- nested learning  
- dynamical systems  
- information and uncertainty  
- intelligence as a system property  

These documents accompany the code and provide the conceptual backbone  
behind the experiments in the repository.

They are intentionally informal and exploratory.
