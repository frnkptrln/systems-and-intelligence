# Conceptual Map – How Everything Connects

## The Central Question

> How does something that appears "intelligent" emerge from the interaction of simple parts – without any single part being intelligent?

This repository approaches this question from several directions.
Each simulation illuminates one aspect; together they form a web of ideas.

## Three Layers

### Layer 1: Self-Organization

**Question:** How does spatial or temporal order emerge from local rules?

| Model | Mechanism | Result |
|:------|:----------|:-------|
| Stigmergy Swarm | Indirect communication (pheromones) | Optimal paths |
| Coupled Oscillators | Pairwise phase coupling | Synchronization |
| Boids | 3 local forces | Swarm formation |
| Reaction-Diffusion | 2 diffusing chemicals | Turing patterns |
| Lenia | Continuous convolution + growth | Lifelike organisms |
| Hebbian Memory | Hebbian correlation | Associative memory |

**Commonality:** No agent knows the big picture. Global structure *emerges*.

### Layer 2: Learning and Adaptation

**Question:** How can a system improve its own dynamics?

| Model | What is learned? | Learning Rule |
|:------|:-----------------|:--------------|
| Nested Learning | Transition matrix of the world | Prediction Error |
| Prediction Error Field | GoL rule (local) | Gradient on weights |
| Meta-Learning | Its own learning rate | Surprise signal modulates η |
| Tensor Logic | Relational structure | Embedding tensor product |

**Commonality:** Information flows *from the world into the model*.
The system becomes an ever-better mirror of its environment.

### Layer 3: Criticality and Limits

**Question:** Is there a privileged zone where systems are "most intelligent"?

- **Self-Organized Criticality** shows: many systems drive themselves to the critical point – between order and chaos. There, information processing is maximal.

- **Limits of Formal Systems** (Gödel, Turing) show: no formal system can know everything about itself. Intelligence operates *at* these limits, not *beyond* them.

## The Common Thread

1. **Simple local rules** → global order (self-organization)
2. **Global order** → usable for prediction and regulation (learning)
3. **Prediction + Regulation + Adaptation** → System Intelligence (SII)
4. **System Intelligence** → measurable via information theory (data-analysis/)
5. **Measurement** → encounters fundamental limits (Gödel, Turing)
6. **Limits** → motivate epistemic humility and further research

Every simulation is a window into this web.
None alone is "the answer" – together they form a **landscape of thought** where intuition and formalization meet.

## Where Do We Stand?

```
What we have:                     What is still missing:
✓ 12 Simulations                  ? More quantitative SII measurements
✓ Information-theoretic measures  ? Comparative phase diagrams
✓ System Intelligence Index       ? Real data (biological systems?)
✓ Theory Essays                   ? Interactive web visualizations
✓ Tensor Logic                    ? Formal proofs about SII properties
```

This repository is not a finished product. It is a **living experiment** – an invitation to think, code, and marvel about systems, intelligence, and emergence.
