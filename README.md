# 🧠 systems-and-intelligence

This repository explores how **intelligence**, **adaptation**, and **structure**
emerge from the interaction of simple components.
It brings together simulation models, theoretical notes, and learning systems
that illustrate how **local rules can generate global behavior**, how systems
stabilize themselves, and how observers learn from the dynamics they inhabit.

The project spans several layers:

- **Self-organization**
- **Nested learning**
- **Emergent regulation**
- **Feedback and control**
- **Limits of computation and intelligence**

Each folder represents a different perspective on these themes.

## 📂 Repository Overview

| Folder | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`simulation-models/`** | Concrete dynamical systems: cellular automata, agent-based simulations, homeostasis models, nested-learning examples. |
| **`data-analysis/`** | Tools for plotting, measuring, and evaluating emergent behavior across simulations. |
| **`tools/`** | Shared utilities for visualization, randomness, grid manipulation, and reproducibility. |
| **`theory/`** | Conceptual notes and essays on systems, intelligence, and emergent behavior. |
| **`meta/`** | Reflections on epistemology, ethics, and the limits of formal systems and computation. |

Each subfolder contains its own README with context and details.
