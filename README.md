# 🧠 systems-and-intelligence

This repository explores how **intelligence**, **adaptation**, and **structure**
emerge from the interaction of simple components.
It brings together simulation models, theoretical notes, and learning systems
that illustrate how **local rules can generate global behavior**, how systems
stabilize themselves, and how observers learn from the dynamics they inhabit.

The project spans several layers:

- **Self-organization**
- **Nested learning**
- **Emergent regulation**
- **Feedback and control**
- **Limits of computation and intelligence**

Each folder represents a different perspective on these themes.

## 💡 About this Project

**Note:** This entire repository is conceived as a *thought experiment* developed by Frank in collaboration with AI. It is primarily a space to capture, explore, and run simulations on complex ideas. Because it's a living, experimental space, it may contain errors or untested hypotheses. Feedback, discussions, and corrections are always welcome!
