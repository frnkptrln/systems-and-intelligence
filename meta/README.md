This section covers broader reflections on:

- epistemology  
- ethics  
- limits of computation  
- Gödel-inspired notions of incompleteness  
- how systems relate to their observers  

These notes touch on the deeper questions behind intelligence,
computation, and the boundaries of formal systems.
